Monte Carlo Simulation for financial project evaluation

mcsim is meant to become a Monte Carlo Simulation program for financial modeling. The user must have the option to model each financial variable with the
- normal distribution, 
- lognormal distribution
- uniform distribution, or 
- triangular distribution. 

As it is already difficult enough to model a financial project correctly, a clear UI is paramount. At this stage an Excel spreadsheet is used — at a later stage we could use PyQt or something similar — for input to test the model.
